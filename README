== Pancake ==

Pancake allows your program to perform just-in-time specialization for your
OpenCL kernels.

Getting this to work requires the following steps:

 * #include <pancake.h> in every source file that makes OpenCL calls *before*
   <CL/cl.hpp> or any other header that might make OpenCL calls or use OpenCL
   data types gets included.
 * Link to libpancake.so
 * Annotate your OpenCL kernels with specialization directives.
